# NodemcuClient

This is a web application built using Angular that visualizes real-time data from an IoT device. The app displays data in two charts: one for accelerometer data (x, y, z axes) and another for temperature data. Additionally, there is a real-time data table that displays the latest values of acceleration magnitude, humidity, and fall detection status (Work in progress :)).

# Installation
