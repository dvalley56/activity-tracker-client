This is a SPA built using Angular that visualizes real-time data from an IoT device. The app displays data in three charts: accelerometer data (x, y, z axes), temperature data and humidity data. Additionally, there is a real-time data table that displays the latest values of acceleration magnitude, humidity, and fall detection status. It also has a simple dashboard page, from where we can visualize the past data. Check the repositery of [server](https://github.com/dvalley56/nodemcu-server) to know more.
